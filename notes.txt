Vyper does not have modifiers. Hardcode requirements with assert directly in the functions. 
Vyper has interesting math capabilities and is able to operate with decimals. Check TestMath for examples. Order matters.
Structs get filled as a dictionary: Loan({key1: value1, key2:value2})
When you call a viewable variable, you can specify which value from the struct you want; <contract>.see_loan()[0] returns value1.
HashMaps are similar to mappings in Solidity. Like mappings, HashMaps are infinite meaning you cannot iterate over it.
